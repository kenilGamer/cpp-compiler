# Overview

Welcome to our **Online Code Editor**!

This web application allows you to write, compile, and run code in several popular languages directly in your browser, including **C++, C, C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript**. It features a modern, responsive UI and a rich editing experience, making it the perfect tool for learning, testing algorithms, and rapid prototyping.

The project is built with a modern tech stack: **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. For a first-class coding experience, it integrates the **Monaco Editor**â€”the same editor that powers VS Code. Secure and efficient code execution is handled by the **Piston API**.
